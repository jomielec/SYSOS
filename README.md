## Install Dependencies
***Important: If you wish not to install these dependencies, you can active the virtual environment with the dependencies already installed. To do so, run the following command (in the SYSOS directory): `source myenv/bin/activate` or in windows PowerShell `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`. Installing the dependencies after this is not necessary.***

### MAC / LINUX
In Mac or linux, run `bash Dependencies.sh`
### WINDOWS
In Windows, double click `Dependencies.bat`

## Usage
In your default CLI of choice, run `bash init.sh` in the `sysos/Unix` directory. In windows, double click `init.bat` in `sysos/Windows`.

## About
The `sysos (experimental).py` contains new features that ***may not be stable, or fully worked out. Please don't expect it to work out of the box!*** If you do encounter any   
issues, do not hesitate to make a bug report.

`sysos-ClassVersion` is a new version of `sysos` that is more compatible and efficient (in most cases). It is not in any way completed yet. Please see the don't expect to much with it.*
